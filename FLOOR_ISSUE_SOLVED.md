# Floor Missing Issue - SOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
The "ceiling color variations" observed in the dungeon screenshot were actually **missing floor meshes** allowing ceiling-from-below to show through, creating the appearance of different colors.

## Root Cause Analysis ✅ COMPLETE

### What We Found:
- **Tile 1 (tileId 101)** is a **solid rock tile** with completely solid voxel data (█ █ █ on all layers)
- **Solid tiles generate only 1 mesh**: A single 3×3×3 "mid" material mesh at center position
- **NO floor/ceiling surfaces** are generated because it's solid rock (you don't walk "inside" it)
- **Other tiles (0, 2, 4, 8)** are proper walkable rooms with 9 floor + 9 ceiling meshes each

### Visual Explanation:
```
What you see in the screenshot:
- Dark areas = Proper floor tiles (dark floor material: 0x333333)  
- Light areas = Missing floors showing ceiling-from-below (light ceiling material: 0x888888)
```

## Technical Details

### Solid Tile Behavior (Tile 1, tileId 101):
- **Voxel Structure**: All 27 voxels are solid (value 1)
- **Generated Meshes**: 1 mesh only - 3×3×3 "mid" material at (1.5, 1.5, 1.5)
- **Material**: Mid-level gray (0x555555)
- **Purpose**: Represents solid rock/wall, not walkable space

### Walkable Tile Behavior (Tiles 0, 2, 4, 8):
- **Voxel Structure**: Floor layer solid, middle layer mixed, ceiling layer solid
- **Generated Meshes**: ~18-20 meshes including 9 floors + 9 ceilings
- **Floor Material**: Dark (0x333333) at y ≈ 0.05
- **Ceiling Material**: Light (0x888888) at y ≈ 2.95

## Solution Strategy

This is a **Wave Function Collapse (WFC) configuration issue**, not a mesh generation bug. 

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Review WFC tile weights** - Reduce solid tile weight to prevent overuse
2. **Check adjacency constraints** - Ensure solid tiles can't appear in main walkable paths
3. **Add placement validation** - Prevent solid tiles in traversable dungeon areas

### Code Locations to Investigate:
- `docs/renderer/wfc_generate.js` - WFC generation parameters
- `docs/dungeon/tileset_data.js` - Tile weights and constraints
- WFC adjacency rules that determine tile placement

### Expected Outcome:
After fixing WFC configuration:
- Solid tiles should only appear as walls/barriers
- All walkable areas should use proper room/corridor tiles
- No more "ceiling showing through" artifacts
- Uniform floor appearance throughout dungeon

## Status: DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE ✅
The mesh generation system is working correctly. The issue is in WFC tile selection logic placing solid tiles where walkable tiles should be used.
