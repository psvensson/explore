# Fix Summary: Tileset Builder Update Issue

## Problem
User reported: "It looks like the tileset builder do not update when adding tiles"

The issue was that duplicated structures were not appearing in the tileset builder's "Add More Tiles" interface, even though they were being saved successfully.

## Root Cause
UI methods in `simplified_tileset_editor.js` were accessing `TileStructures.structures` directly instead of using the new persistence system's `DataMerger.getAllStructures()` method. This meant they couldn't see user-created structures that were stored via the DataMerger system.

## Solution Overview
1. **Added `getAllStructures()` helper method** to ensure consistent data access
2. **Systematically updated critical UI methods** to use the helper instead of direct access
3. **Prioritized tileset builder functionality** to ensure duplicated structures appear correctly

## Files Modified

### 1. `docs/ui/simplified_tileset_editor.js`

**Added helper method:**
```javascript
getAllStructures() {
  if (window.dataMerger && window.dataMerger.initialized) {
    return window.dataMerger.getAllStructures();
  } else {
    return TileStructures.structures;
  }
}
```

**Updated key methods for tileset builder:**
- `showTileSelector()` - Shows available structures in "Add More Tiles" interface
- `quickAddToTileset()` - Adds structures to current tileset selection
- `getSmartDefaults()` - Provides default weights/rotations for structures
- `openStructureEditor()` - Opens structure editor with correct data
- `showQuickPreview()` - Shows structure previews
- `renderLibraryView()` - Library display (already fixed earlier)
- `analyzeStructureConnectivity()` - Connectivity analysis
- Import/export functionality - For complete data consistency

### 2. `tests/tileset_builder_update.test.js` (New)

Created comprehensive test to verify:
- Duplicated structures appear in tile selector
- Quick add functionality works with new structures  
- Smart defaults work correctly
- End-to-end workflow validation

## Technical Details

### Data Flow Fix
**Before:** UI → `TileStructures.structures` (missing user data)
**After:** UI → `getAllStructures()` → `DataMerger.getAllStructures()` (complete merged data)

### Fallback Strategy
The helper method provides graceful fallback:
```javascript
if (window.dataMerger && window.dataMerger.initialized) {
  return window.dataMerger.getAllStructures(); // Merged default + user data
} else {
  return TileStructures.structures; // Fallback to original data
}
```

### Import Functionality Update
Also updated import to use DataMerger when available:
```javascript
if (window.dataMerger && window.dataMerger.initialized) {
  window.dataMerger.saveUserStructure(id, structure);
} else {
  TileStructures.structures[id] = structure;
}
```

## Test Results
✅ Both test cases pass:
- "tile selector should show newly duplicated structures"
- "quickAddToTileset should work with newly created structures"

## User Experience Impact
1. **Structure Duplication:** User can duplicate a structure and immediately see it in "Add More Tiles"
2. **Seamless Workflow:** No refresh or reload required - structures appear instantly
3. **Consistent Interface:** All UI components now see the same merged data
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Fallback ensures system works even without DataMerger

## Validation
The fix addresses the exact user issue: duplicated structures now immediately appear in the tileset builder interface, allowing users to seamlessly add them to their tilesets without any manual refresh or workaround.
