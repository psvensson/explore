# ✅ Fixed: Empty Mesh Style Selector Widget

## Problem Fixed
The "Visual Style" widget was appearing but the dropdown was empty with no styles to select.

## Root Cause
**Timing issue:** The mesh generators are initialized asynchronously in `renderer.js` after THREE.js loads, but the widget was trying to access them immediately before they were ready.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. ✅ Retry Logic with Timeout
The widget now **waits up to 5 seconds** (10 attempts × 500ms) for generators to initialize:

```javascript
async _waitForGenerators(maxAttempts = 10, delayMs = 500)
```

### 2. ✅ Loading State
The widget shows **"Loading styles..."** with a **Retry button** while waiting:
- User sees feedback that something is happening
- Can manually retry if needed

### 3. ✅ Error Handling
If generators fail to load after 5 seconds:
- Shows clear error message
- Logs detailed error to console
- Suggests user to generate dungeon first

### 4. ✅ Extensive Debug Logging
Added console logs at every step:
```
[GeneratorPanel] Initializing mesh style selector...
[GeneratorPanel] Mesh style widget created, initializing registry...
[MeshStyleSelector] Waiting for generators... (attempt 1/10)
[MeshStyleSelector] Generators loaded: ['voxel-cube', 'low-poly']
[GeneratorPanel] Registry initialized, mounting widget...
[GeneratorPanel] Mesh style selector fully initialized!
```

### 5. ✅ Manual Refresh Button
Added a "↻ Retry" button that:
- Appears when generators aren't loaded
- User can click to manually retry
- Re-initializes the widget

## What to Expect Now

### Scenario A: Generators Load Quickly ✅
1. Page loads
2. Widget shows "Loading styles..." for < 1 second
3. Dropdown populates with "Cubic Voxels" and "Low-Poly"
4. Ready to use!

### Scenario B: Generators Load Slowly ⏱️
1. Page loads
2. Widget shows "Loading styles..." with retry button
3. Console shows: `[MeshStyleSelector] Waiting for generators... (attempt X/10)`
4. After 1-3 seconds, dropdown populates
5. Ready to use!

### Scenario C: Generators Fail ❌
1. Page loads
2. Widget shows "Loading styles..." with retry button
3. After 5 seconds, shows error: "⚠️ Mesh generators not available"
4. User can:
   - Click "↻ Retry" button
   - Generate a dungeon first (triggers full bootstrap)
   - Check console for error details

## How to Use

### Normal Flow:
1. **Open app** in browser
2. **Wait 1-2 seconds** for widget to load
3. **See dropdown** populate with styles
4. **Select a style** (e.g., "Low-Poly")
5. **Click "Apply"**
6. **Dungeon regenerates** with new style!

### If Widget Shows "Loading...":
1. **Wait 5 seconds** - it's retrying automatically
2. **OR** click **"↻ Retry"** button to retry immediately
3. **OR** click **"Generate"** button first to trigger bootstrap

## Debugging

### Check Console Logs
Enable debug mode:
```javascript
window.__DEBUG_MESH_GENERATORS__ = true;
```

### Manual Test
Run in browser console:
```javascript
// Test if generators loaded
import('./renderer/mesh-generators/index.js').then(m => {
  const registry = m.getGeneratorRegistry();
  console.log('Generators:', registry.getGeneratorIds());
  // Should show: ['voxel-cube', 'low-poly']
});
```

### Complete Debug Test
Copy-paste this into browser console:
```javascript
(async () => {
  const { getGeneratorRegistry } = await import('./renderer/mesh-generators/index.js');
  const registry = getGeneratorRegistry();
  const ids = registry.getGeneratorIds();
  
  console.log('Generators loaded:', ids.length > 0 ? '✓ YES' : '✗ NO');
  console.log('Generator IDs:', ids);
  console.log('Active:', registry.getActiveGeneratorId());
  
  if (ids.length === 0) {
    console.log('→ Try: Click Generate button, wait 2 seconds, then click ↻ Retry');
  }
})();
```

## Files Changed

### Modified:
1. **`docs/ui/widgets/mesh-style-selector.js`**
   - Added `_waitForGenerators()` method with retry logic
   - Added `_showErrorState()` for error display
   - Updated template to show loading/retry state
   - Added 'refresh-styles' action handler
   - Enhanced logging throughout

2. **`docs/ui/widgets/generator-panel.js`**
   - Added extensive console logging
   - Better error handling and messages

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Just Wait
Most common: Widget is still loading. **Wait 2-3 seconds.**

### Fix 2: Click Retry
If showing "Loading styles...", **click the "↻ Retry" button**.

### Fix 3: Generate First
If retry doesn't work, **click "Generate" button** to create a dungeon first. This ensures the full renderer (including generators) is initialized.

### Fix 4: Hard Refresh
If all else fails, **hard refresh** the page: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac).

## Success Indicators

✅ **Working correctly when you see:**
- Dropdown shows "Cubic Voxels" and "Low-Poly"
- Console shows: `[MeshStyleSelector] Generators loaded: ['voxel-cube', 'low-poly']`
- No error messages in console
- Clicking Apply regenerates dungeon

## Still Not Working?

If the dropdown is still empty after trying all fixes:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Copy all the red error messages**
3. **Run the debug test** (from "Manual Test" section above)
4. **Check the output** - it will tell you exactly what's wrong

The most common issues are:
- Import map not loaded (check `index.html`)
- THREE.js failed to load (check network tab)
- JavaScript error in generator code (check console for errors)

## Testing

Run tests to verify no regressions:
```bash
npm test
```

Expected: **211 tests passing** (same as before)

---

**Summary:** The widget now properly handles async generator initialization with retry logic, loading states, and manual refresh capability. It should populate with styles within 1-3 seconds of page load. If not, use the "↻ Retry" button or generate a dungeon first.
