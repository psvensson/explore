# My Dungeon Web

My Dungeon Web is a web-based application that allows users to explore and interact with procedurally generated dungeons in a 3D environment. The project is built using plain vanilla HTML, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript, and leverages the three.js library for rendering 3D graphics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **UI**: This component provides controls and widgets for users to interact with the dungeon generator and the 3D renderer. It allows users to customize parameters and visualize the generated dungeons.
  
- **3D Renderer**: This component utilizes three.js to create a 3D representation of the generated dungeon. It includes features for zooming and panning the camera, providing an immersive experience for users.
  
- **Dungeon Generator**: This component implements algorithms for generating dungeons based on user-defined parameters. It visualizes the generated dungeons in the 3D renderer.
