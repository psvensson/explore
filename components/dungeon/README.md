# Dungeon Generator Component

The Dungeon Generator component is responsible for creating and visualizing dungeons based on specified parameters. This component utilizes algorithms to generate various types of dungeons, allowing users to customize the layout, size, and complexity of the generated environments.

## Features

- **Dungeon Generation Algorithms**: Implements various algorithms for generating dungeons, including random generation and procedural techniques.
- **Customization Options**: Users can specify parameters such as dungeon size, room count, and complexity to tailor the generated dungeon to their needs.
- **Visualization**: Provides a way to visualize the generated dungeon, allowing users to see the layout and structure in real-time.

## Usage

To use the Dungeon Generator component, include the `dungeon.js` script in your HTML file. You can then call the provided functions to generate a dungeon and visualize it within the 3D renderer.

### Example

```javascript
import { generateDungeon } from './dungeon.js';

// Generate a dungeon with specified parameters
const dungeon = generateDungeon({
    width: 10,
    height: 10,
    roomCount: 5,
    complexity: 3
});

// Visualize the generated dungeon
visualizeDungeon(dungeon);
```

## Customization

The dungeon generation can be customized through the following parameters:

- **width**: The width of the dungeon grid.
- **height**: The height of the dungeon grid.
- **roomCount**: The number of rooms to generate within the dungeon.
- **complexity**: A value that determines the complexity of the dungeon layout.

## Conclusion

The Dungeon Generator component is a powerful tool for creating diverse and interesting dungeon layouts. By adjusting the parameters, users can create unique dungeons suitable for various applications, such as games or simulations.
