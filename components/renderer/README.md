# Renderer Component Documentation

## Overview
The Renderer component is responsible for rendering a 3D scene using Three.js. It provides the functionality to visualize the dungeon generated by the Dungeon component and allows users to interact with the 3D environment through zooming and panning.

## Features
- **3D Scene Setup**: Initializes the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.
- **Camera Controls**: Implements zoom and pan functionalities to navigate the 3D space.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with the UI and Dungeon components to display generated dungeons.

## Usage
To use the Renderer component, ensure that the `renderer.js` script is included in your HTML file. The script will automatically set up the 3D environment and listen for user interactions.

### Initialization
Call the `initRenderer()` function to set up the scene and camera. This function should be invoked after the DOM is fully loaded.

### Camera Controls
The Renderer component supports mouse controls for zooming and panning:
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the scene.
- **Pan**: Click and drag the mouse to move the camera around the scene.

## Configuration Options
You can customize the renderer's settings by modifying the parameters in the `initRenderer()` function. Options include:
- **Field of View**: Adjust the camera's field of view for a wider or narrower perspective.
- **Aspect Ratio**: Set the aspect ratio based on the canvas size.

## Example
Here is a basic example of how to initialize the renderer:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    initRenderer();
});
```

## Dependencies
This component relies on the Three.js library. Ensure that it is included in your project before using the Renderer component.

## Conclusion
The Renderer component is a crucial part of the dungeon visualization project, providing an interactive 3D experience. For further details on integration with other components, refer to the main project README and the documentation for the UI and Dungeon components.
